How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
-By integrating functional vs nonfunctional tests. We can also lookinto static vs dynamic testing to ensure our code is written appropriately and functions as intented. Our testing can be as in depth as needed. Some simple programs dont need to go super deep. As the complexity rises and the nature of the code has to have strong integrity we can optimize our testing in its nature.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
-By communicating what is needed and what they would like included into the program we can make a requirements list that is detailed with the specifications they specifiy. At this point we can help facilitate what is needed and what is wanted and distinguish what needs to be done.

How do I approach designing software?
-Typically a ground up approach is needed. For desigining software we need a strong foundation to be laid down so we can build apon it as needed.
Starting with a customers idea and laying the forground to be worked into their described idea. We can then start to make a requierments document and work with them along the way. As we are adding functionality we keep the conversation open with them and updated so if there is something that needs to be addressed it we can be ontop of it asap. Software requirements these days is also inclusive of security, performance, and maintinence. We need to take these steps to ensure we have a quality overall product that our customer is satisfied with.
